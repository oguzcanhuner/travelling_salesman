reinforcement learning algorith:

- randomly traverse the grid, collecting a set of edges crossed, and assigning each edge a score, depending on the weight of that edge


- for i iterations
 - for the number of nodes
  - start at node 0 and pick one random node and add it to the 'visited' array, with a score for that edge
 -end
-end
